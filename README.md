# WordPress Docker Container

Lightweight WordPress container with Nginx 1.24 & PHP-FPM 8.2 based on Alpine Linux.

_WordPress version currently installed:_ **6.4.1**

* Used in production for many sites, making it stable, tested and up-to-date
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's ondemand PM)
* Works with Amazon Cloudfront or CloudFlare as SSL terminator and CDN
* Multi-platform, supporting AMD4, ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64
* Built on the lightweight Alpine Linux distribution
* Small Docker image size (+/-90MB)
* Uses PHP 8.2 for the best performance, low cpu usage & memory footprint
* Can safely be updated without losing data
* Fully configurable because wp-config.php uses the environment variables you can pass as an argument to the container
